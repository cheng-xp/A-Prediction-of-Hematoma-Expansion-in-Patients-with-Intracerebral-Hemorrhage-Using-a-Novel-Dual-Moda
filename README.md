![这里随便写文字]()
Figure S1. A schematic illustration of the 10-fold cross-validation. The blue, yellow, and  green blocks represent the training, testing, and validation sets, respectively. For each fold of the validation, we randomly selected 75% of the samples for the training set, 15% for the testing set and 10% for the validation set. The averaged performance was used to represent the overall performance of the proposed method. Note:  F1= Fold 1, F2= Fold 2, ... , F10=Fold 10.

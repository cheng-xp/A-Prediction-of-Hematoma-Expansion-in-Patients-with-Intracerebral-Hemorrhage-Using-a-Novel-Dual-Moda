Figure S1. Yellow block: tesing set. Green block：validation set. Blue block: training set. R1= Round 1, R2= Round 2, R3= Round 3, R10=Rouond 10. We selected 75% of the samples for the training set, 15% for the testing set and 10% for the validation set for 10 times of training and testing. The averaged parameters were derived to represent the performance of the proposed method.
